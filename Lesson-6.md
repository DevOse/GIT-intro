# Working with remote repositories - 2

## Downloading Repos from GitHub
You can create a repository in one of two ways  
1. Create one locally using `git init`.
2. Get one online (remote repository).

You are already familiar with the first step. Now, let's get a remote repository from "Git-Hub-learn"'s profile on __GitHub__.




<!-- #
The remote repository takes the most recent commit, and uses that to create the files on the server. 


When you created your new repository, you initialized it with a README file. README files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your README file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository.

Let's commit a change to the README file.

In your repository's list of files, click README.md.

Readme file in file list
Above the file's content, click .

On the Edit file tab, type some information about yourself.

New content in file
Above the new content, click Preview changes.

File preview button
Review the changes you made to the file. You'll see the new content in green.

File preview view
At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see "Creating a commit with multiple co-authors."

Commit message for your change
Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is master, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request.

Commit branch options
Click Propose file change.
