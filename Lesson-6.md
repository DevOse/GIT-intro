# Working with remote repositories - 2

Last lesson, you created an account on __GitHub__ and pushed a commit to your remote repository.  You are now a proud owner of a __GitHub__ account, giving you access to thousands of projects being built online. 

In this lesson, we are taking a tour of __GitHub__. __GitHub__ is a social coding site that offers a lot of features for sharing projects and collaboration.

## Working with __GitHub__
Sign in to GITHUBHOMEPAGE. You should see a screen with a dark menu bar at the top. 

This menu contains (from left-to-right)  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4.   
	

Below the menu, the screen is divided into three sections.



## Downloading Repos from GitHub
You can create a repository in one of two ways  
1. Create one locally using `git init`.
2. Get one online (remote repository).

You are already familiar with the first step. Now, let's get a remote repository from "Git-Hub-learn"'s profile on __GitHub__.




<!-- #
The remote repository takes the most recent commit, and uses that to create the files on the server. 


When you created your new repository, you initialized it with a README file. README files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your README file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository.

Let's commit a change to the README file.

In your repository's list of files, click README.md.

Readme file in file list
Above the file's content, click .

On the Edit file tab, type some information about yourself.

New content in file
Above the new content, click Preview changes.

File preview button
Review the changes you made to the file. You'll see the new content in green.

File preview view
At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see "Creating a commit with multiple co-authors."

Commit message for your change
Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is master, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request.

Commit branch options
Click Propose file change.

Propose file change button
Celebrate
Congratulations! You have now created a repository, including a README file, and created your first commit on GitHub. What do you want to do next?

"Set up Git"
Create a repository
"Fork a repository"
"Be social"
