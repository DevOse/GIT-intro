# PART 1: An Introduction to __Git__ and __GitHub__

The software we use on our various computer devices all run on code; without code, your phone, and most modern electronics, would just be boring, lifeless, metallic boxes. Code is what software is made of, and it is written by people we call _programmers_. 

The web sites and applications you use today are rarely written by a single programmer. Programmers usually work in teams, building and crafting software by writing multiple lines of codes across various files. The code they write adds new features, fixes issues, or improve old features. The software you use today go through a lot of refining to make them work better, faster, and nicer.

As a project grows (especially for large programs or software), it becomes important to record or monitor the changes that occur over time. There are various ways to watch, or track, these changes. These methods are collectively called version control systems -- systems designed to track various versions of a project. This is where __Git__ comes in.

__Git__ is a version control tool, a program that helps monitor changes in your project. It can be an incredibly difficult tool to understand, but once one grasps it, it becomes an indispensable tool, very useful in multiple ways. And the great thing is you don't have to be a programmer to find __Git__ useful - designers, writers, and others from various fields have found it useful.

__GitHub__ is an online, social website that runs on __Git__ - think __Git__ on steriods. Programmers can save their projects on __GitHub__ and easily share it with other colleagues. __GitHub__ also adds some extra features to __Git__, mostly aimed at improving collaboration among coders.

This tutorial will teach you the basics of __Git__ and __GitHub__. At the end of this tutorial, you would learn how to work and collaborate with programmers worldwide.

## PREREQUISITES
 - You should be comfortable using a computer and the Internet.
 - Little knowledge of the command line is required. Don't worry if you have never heard of it - the tutorial also contains a guide to the command line.
 - Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
 - A recent version of Windows. This guide was written for Windows users. Linux users might find it useful too.
