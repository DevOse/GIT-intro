# Part 4: Repositories and Version Control

Last lesson, we learnt how to use Git Bash. We also learnt a few commands to navigate, view, and list the contents of our directories. In this lesson, we will create our first Git repo, and begin working on our project files.

> I define a software as a way of thinking, a way of doing a particular task. Understanding how **Git** thinks is very important if you want to use it properly and efficiently.

## Version Control With Git
For this lesson, we will be working in our project directory. Open Git bash and navigate to your project folder to begin.

>
    You can also start Git Bash using the Windows Explorer. 
* In Windows explorer, open your project folder  
![The Project Folder](./screenshots/17-ProjectFolder.png)  
*viewing the project folder in Windows Explorer...*  


* Right Click, and select "Git Bash here" to start Git Bash. This forces Git bash to use this folder as your working directory when it launches.

* When Git Bash starts, confirm your working directory is the project directory by using the command *pwd*

## Configuring Git
Be patient.. we will soon create our first repository. Before we do that, we should make some changes on our git configuration. Remember that GIT is meant for collaboration, right? How do programmers know which programmer has made changes to the project?

__IDENTITIES__

Git comes along with a configuration tool that lets you set and update various information. Updating your identity is the first thing you should do after installing Git. This will be useful in the future, when you upload your repositories to GitHub.

To add your name to Git config, type the following command  
`git config --global user.name "Your name" `  

To update your email, you type something similar  
`git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"`  

![pwd in git bash](./screenshots/20-configGit.png)  


To view your configuration setting, type  
`git config user.name`  or `git config user.email`

This will display the current name or email. 

![pwd in git bash](./screenshots/21-ConfigGit.png)  

Now, let's create our repository.

## Creating a repository
Git uses what we call "repositories" to store information about your project's changes. This "repository" is a special folder Git creates in your project folder, when Git is initialized. Repositories are sometimes called 'repos'.

To create a git repository, in the terminal, type 

`git init`

![pwd in git bash](./screenshots/22-GitInitialize.png)  

The terminal prints a message saying that a git repository has been initialized in your project folder.

To see the git repo, type

` ls `

![pwd in git bash](./screenshots/23-LsAfterGit.png)  

Wait... that didn't show anything. Where is the git repo?

### Command line arguments

Some of the commands you use in the command line will let you add options. Options are like special effects on commands; they make them do something special.

The regular 'ls' command only lists files that are not hidden. Windows allows you to hide files, so they do not show up by default. To view hidden file, you will type ls with an option '-a'. This will allow ls list all files in a folder, hidden files inclusive. 

![pwd in git bash](./screenshots/24-LsWithAoptio.png)  

The git folder has a '.' in front of it. The '.' indicates that the folder is hidden. 
This folder is for git-only. Not for you. It's where Git stores and monitors the changes you make as your project grows.

In the next tutorial, we will learn how to make git work for us.
