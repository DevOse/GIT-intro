# Introduction To GIT and GITHUB
### by Kachi Awaji

This repo contains a short introduction to GIT and GITHUB. The command line is also covered. 

I struggled a lot trying to understand GIT, GITHUB, and the whole idea of version control. This is my attempt to make the journey smoother for others. 

I appreciate feedback and comments. Feel free to fork, and modify in your own way.

Goodluck.
