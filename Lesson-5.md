In the previous section, we created a local repository and made our first commits. We also learnt to use the `git commit` command to save changes to the repository, and learnt the `git log` command for viewing our repo's history.

What if you'd like to share your repository with other programmers? You can do that using __Git__ and an online service that lets you host __Git__ repositories. In this lesson, we will learn to create remote repositories using __GitHub__, an online code-hosting platform.

__Git__ is a _distributed_ VCS (version control system). This means the git repository in your project folder can be shared with others. This will let them have not just access to your files, they'd also be able to view the history of the project too(view the commits you have made). You can share your repository with others by hosting them online.

A few services that let you host repositories online include __GitHub__, __Bitbucket__, __GitLab__ and a few others. GitHub is the most popular and our focus in this series.

To host repositories on __GitHub__, create an account by visiting [their website](https://www.github.com). I
